- Internet Control Message Protocol - ICMP

	ICMP is one of the most critical protocols that lives in layer three.
	
	> Stands for Internet Control Message Protocol
	> Designed for informational messages
		* Host unreachable, port unreachable, fragmentation needed
		* Packet expired (infinite loop in routers)
	> Uses IP directly
	> PING and traceroute use it
	> Doesn't require listeners or ports to be opened
	
	//--There is no port to listen to get the ICMP messages.
	//--You can send an ICMP message any time you want, as long as
	  the host itself enables ICMP.

	> Some firewalls block ICMP for security reasons
	> This is why PING might not work in those cases
	> Disabling ICMP also can cause real damage with connection establishment
	      (TCP blackhole)
	  	* Fragmentation needed


- PING

- TraceRoute

	> Can you identify the entire path your IP Packet takes?
	> Clever use of TTL
	> Increment TTL slowly and you will get the router IP address for each hop
	> Doesn't always work as path changes and ICMP might be blocked
