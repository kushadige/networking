Building blocks that we need to understand in order to understand
the IP Protocol.

- What happened when you actually route a packet? What happened
  when I sending a packet?

	Packet is a bunch of data with destination IP address, with source
	IP address. (with other headers)

	IP Adress
	> Layer 3 property
	> Can be set automatically or statically
	> Network and Host portion
	> 4 bytes in IPv4 - 32 bits

	Network vs Host
	> a.b.c.d/x (a.b.c.d are integers) x is the network bits and remains
	are host
	> Example 192.168.254.0/24
	> The first 24 bits (3 bytes) are network the rest 8 are for host
	> This means we can have 2^24 (16777216) networks and each network has
	2^8 (255) hosts
	> Also called a subnet

	Subnet Mask
	> 192.168.254.0/24 is also called a subnet
	> The subnet must have a subnet mask 255.255.255.0
	> Subnet mask is used to determine whether an IP is in the same subnet

	*You want to know that is this IP address that I'm about to send to
	belong to my subnet or not. If it's in my subnet, I can use the MAC address
	to send it directly (h2h). If it's not I need to talk to someone who knows how to
	route this and this is usually called a router or a gateway.
	That's why you have a gateway IP address.


	Default Gateway
	> Most networks consists of hosts and a Default Gateway
	> Host A can talk to B directly if both are in the same subnet
	> Otherwise A sends it to someone who might know, the gateway
	> The Gateway has an IP Address and each host should know its gateway

	The gateway is just another device that happened to have two network interfaces.
	One network that is assigned to belong to this network, and another network
	that belongs to another network or maybe three or for or five or six...


	E.g. Host 192.168.1.3 wants to talk to 192.168.1.2
	> 192.168.1.3 applies subnet mask to itself and the destination
	 IP 192.168.1.2
	> 255.255.255.0 & 192.168.1.3 = 192.168.1.0
	> 255.255.255.0 & 192.168.1.2 = 192.168.1.0
	> Same subnet ! no need to route

	E.g. Host 192.168.1.3 wants to talk to 192.168.2.2
	> 192.168.1.3 applies subnet mask to itself and the destination
	 IP 192.168.2.2
	> 255.255.255.0 & 192.168.1.3 = 192.168.1.0
	> 255.255.255.0 & 192.168.2.2 = 192.168.2.0
	> Not the subnet ! The packet is sent to the Default Gateway
	 192.168.1.100
