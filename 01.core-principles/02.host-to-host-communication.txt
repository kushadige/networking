- How messages are sent between hosts?

	This is layer two concepts most of this stuff and layer three, sometimes..
	> We need to send a message from host A to host B
	> Usually a request to do something on host B (RPC)
		"Hey! I'm sending an RPC call."
		"Hey, B! Do my work for me, please."
	> Each host has a network card with a unique Media Access Control address (MAC)
	> E.g. 00:00:5e:00:53:af

	
	|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|			     |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|
	|   A   | ------------------ |   B   | 
	|_______|			     |_______|
	
  00:00:5e:00:53:af		 00:00:3a:12:31:0b

	
	> A sends a message to B specifying the MAC address
	> Everyone in the network will "get" the message but only B will accept it

	When it sends to network, It has no idea where to send the data exactly.
	"Hey! let's send a message.. Whoever have this MAC address, please get my message."
	Then we have to go up to layer two to look at the MAC address and 
	compare it to ourselves.
	So everyone, A, B, C, D will get this frame of data. Then we'll look at
	it says okay this is destined to be "I am B" take it! and send that frame
	to the higher levels the layer.

	Actually security wise is dangerous. That's how what happened in public Wi-Fi
	connection.

	//--If you have a sniffer that just gets the MAC address but doesn't really
	drop it. That's how sniffing networks.

	> Imagine millions of machines?
	> We need a way to eliminate the need to send it to everyone
	> The address needs to get better
	> We need "routability", meet the IP Address..

	
	> The IP Address is built in two parts.
	> One part to identify the network, the other is the host.
	> It 4 bytes but it describes sets of 4 billion devices.
	> We use the network portion to eliminate many networks.
	> The host part is used to find the host
	> Still needs MAC addresses!

	C: 192.168.1.3			  C: 192.168.2.3



	192.168.1.1 wants to talk to 192.168.2.2 
	These are different networks. There's something called the subnet mask.
	You apply that, which is basically this slash 24. And if you get a dif-
	ferent number, that means you are not in the same network. If you get
	the same number you're on the same network.

	//--(192.168.1).(1)
	// First part is the network. Second part is the host.

	If you are not in the same network send the message to the router,
	which is your gateway, and that gateway take care of routing it to some-
	where else.


	But my host have many apps..

	> It's not enough just to address the host..
	> The host is runnings many apps each with different requirements.
	> Meet ports
	> You can send an HTTP request on port 80, a DNS request on port 53 and
	a SSH request on port 22 all running on the same server!

	Ports is what? Why do we use here?

	> We use ports in addition to the IP address to know "Okey yea.. The router
	  did a job deliver the packet to me as a host. But I need to know where do
	  you want to go, which process? I have thousands of processes"
	
	  and that the port, the destination port and the source port is also 
	  important to understand where exactly you need to go.
