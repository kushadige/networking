3. NAT

- Network Address Translation
	
	How the WAN (Wide Area Network) sees your internal devices?

	The Network Address Translation (NAT) Table lives in the router and maps the private IP Addresses which is start with "10.0.0" or "192.168" or "172" to a public image so that if Google want to respond back to my machine, that has a private IP Address, it doesn't even know it is actually a private device, it just responds to the public router and gives you the source port, the destination port in this case, and the router does the mapping.

	"Oh, source 7.7.7.7 going to that, that was actually that particular machine"


	> IPv4 is limited only 4 billion.
	> Private vs Public IP Address
	> E.g. 192.168.x.x, 10.0.0.x is private not routable in the Internet
	> Internal hosts can be assigned private addresses
	> Only your router need public IP address
	> Router need to translate requests

	Routers has both the public and private network address.


- NAT Table

	Router:
		private: 192.168.1.1
		public: 44.11.5.17

	AAA:
		private: 192.168.1.2

	FFF:
		private: 55.11.22.33

	
	> AAA wants to talk FFFF


	|8992|192.168.1.2|
	|7777|44.11.5.17|GET/|55.11.22.33|8080|

	|192.168.1.2:8892|44.11.5.17:7777|55.11.22.33|


	> What is the maximum record in the NAT Table when the same machine want to visit the same destination on the same port?
	> The same app can only make 65.000 connections


- NAT Applications

	> Private to Public translations
		*	So we don't run out IPv4
	
	> Port forwarding
		*	Add a NAT entry in the router to forward packets to 80 to a machine in your LAN
		* 	No need to have root access to listen on port 80 on your device
		* 	Expose your local web server publically

	> Layer 4 Load Balancing
		*	HAProxy NAT Mode - Your load balancer is your gateway
		* 	Clients send a request to a bogus service IP
		* 	Router intercepts that packet and replaces the service IP with a destination server
		* 	Layer 4 reverse proxying
