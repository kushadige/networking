4. TCP Connection States

	> TCP is a stateful protocol.
	> Stateful protocol must have states.
	> Both client and server need to maintain all sorts of state
	> Window sizes, sequences and the state of the connection
	> The connection goes through many states


- TCP Pros

	> Guarantee delivery
	> No one can send data without prior knowledge
	> Flow Control and Congestion Control
	> Ordered Packets no corruption or app level work
	> Secure and can't be easily spoofed


- TCP Cons

	> Large header overhead compared to UDP (20 byte up to 60 bytes)
	> More bandwidth
	> Stateful - consumes memory on server and client
	> Considered high latency for certain workloads (Slow start/ congestion/ acks)
	> Does too much at a low level (hence QUIC)
		*	Single connection to send multiple streams of data (HTTP requests)
		*	Stream 1 has nothing to do with Stream 2
		* 	Both Stream 1 and Stream 2 packets must arrive
	> TCP Meltdown
		*	Not a good candidate for VPN
