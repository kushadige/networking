- Congestion Control

    How much the network can handle?

    > The receiver might handle the load but the middle boxes might not
    > The routers in the middle have limit
    > We don't want to congest the network with data
    > We need to avoid congestion
    > A new window: Congestion Window (CWND)

- Two Congestion algorithms

    > TCP Slow Start (exponential)
        *   Start slow goes fast!
        *   CWND + 1 MSS(Maximum Segment Size) after each ACK

        With every acknowledgement that we get, we increase one MS

        Maximum Segment Size can be 1460 bytes.

        Receiver Window we established receiver will handle a lot up to 1GB some receivers will handle, but will your Congestion Window can handle up to 1GB? NO, your networks in the middle will die..

    > Congestion Avoidance (linear)
        *   Once Slow start reaches its threshold this kicks in
        *   CWND + 1 MSS after complete RTT (Roundtrip Time)

        If you send like five segments, you got to wait for the 5 to be acknowledged.

        Let's say you acknowledge numer 2 and then number three ... and finally acknowledge 5. That's one round trip.

    > CWND must not exceeds RWND


- Slow Start

    > CWND starts with 1 MSS (or more)
    > Send 1 Segment and waits for ACK
    > With EACH ACK received CWND is incremented by 1 MSS.
    > Until we reach slow start threshold we switch to congestion avoidence algorithm.

- Congestion Avoidance

    > Send CWND worth of Segments and waits for ACK
    > Only when ALL segments are ACKed add UP to one MSS to CWND
    > Precisely CWND = CWND + MSS*MSS/CWND

- Congestion Notification

    > We don't want routers dropping packets
    > Can Routers let us know when congestion hit?
    > Meet ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification)
    > Routers and middle boxes can tag IP packets with ECN
    > The receiver will copy this bit back to the sender
    > ECN is IP Header bit
    > So Routers don't drop packets just let me know you are reaching your limit


- Summary

    > While the receiver may handle large data middle boxes might not
    > Middle routers buffers may fill up
    > Need to control the congestion in the network
    > Sender can send segments up to CWND or RWND without ACK
    > Isn't normally a problem in hosts connected directly (LAN)
